      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>Hi! My name is Krystal and I'm currently a student at the University of Michigan studying Business and User Experience Design. Many of my passions lie within the intersection of business and technology. However, like many others during quarantine, I've also rediscovered interests from the past - for me this was rekindling my love for the creative arts, and specifically, video creation. Over the summer I started filming, editing, and uploading videos on YouTube related to productivity, lifestyle, and more. I've created this website to document and share my journey as I learn and grow not only as an individual in business x tech, but also as a digital creative. </br> Thanks for visiting and hope you enjoy! :) </p>
